   The state_storable class is inherited by all objects for which state needs
   to be stored and retrieved so that a simulation may be processed further at
   another time.
   The specific functions that are defined in the derived classes should
   call on a derivative object of state_file_format to store and retrieve
   such elemental things as numerical data, list syntax, etc.
