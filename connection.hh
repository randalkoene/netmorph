  // response amplitudes of synapses to obtain a combined
  // strength of input through a connection.
  // In doing so, it assumes a specific postsynaptic membrane
  // potential Vm and simultaneous arrival of input through
  // all synapses of this connection. The differences between
  // synaptic reversal potentials Erev and Vm are used together
  // with the peak responses of the synaptic conductances to
  // obtain approximated peak currents. Those are summed and
  // become the abstract strength value.
  // If abstract() is called only once, instead of during
  // each iteration of activity processing, then Vm is Vrest
  // so that constant strength contributions are made and
  // so that summed currents through multiple connections
  // take a constant amount of time to lead to a spike (if
  // threshold can be reached).
  // A more detailed spiking neuron network representation
  // is achieved by calling abstract() during each iteration
  // so that synaptic contributions elicited at different
  // times or changes of the synapses can be accounted for.
  // Note: A different approach is to produce analytical
  // or sampled numerical combined responses. Those can then
  // be used exactly as in a simplified spiking neuronal
  // network simulation.
  // Note: Another approach is to convert time dependent
  // processes to an event representation with summable
  // spline pieces, the event-predictive emulation method.
