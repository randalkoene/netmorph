// into account and seeks to achieve the connection statistics specified.

// Two functions of classes derived from synapse_formation_model are
// essential for the generation of synaptic connections:
// 1. evaluate_possible_connection(): This uses any appropriate measure to
//    determine if a candidate synapse is in order (e.g. distance).
// 2. establish_connections(): This is a response to any relevant conditions
//    (e.g. electrical activity, distance, pre- and postsynaptic neuron types,
//    age of neurons or of their connection, etc.) that determines how many
//    receptors of which type exist at a connection. 
//
// An alternative model of synapse formation that establishes actual synapses
// sooner and thereby enables early termination of network development is
// described as a consideration for future work (see

Selecting actual synapses (and their receptors) for each connection:
(1) Initially, connections contains one candidate synapse each.
(2) A synapse formation model, such as the one accessed through sfm knows
    the network to which it applies. Therefore, establish_connections() can
    handle the connections of each neuron in turn.
(3) The function possible_syntypes can be used to obtain an initial probable
    distribution of specific synaptic receptor types for a given pair of
    pre- and postsynaptic neurons.
(4) A synapse is created for each type of receptor at a connection.
(5) The distribution ratios are used as initial parameters for the individual
    synapses and affect the values computed by their transmission functions.
(6) If a connection ends up having no synaptic receptors then no synapses are
    created. This can happen for instance if connections between a specific
    pair of pre- and postsynaptic neurons are not possible.
(7) The candidate synapse is removed.
