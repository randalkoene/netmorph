## Installation


NETMORPH depends on the GNU system libraries and is written in standard
C++, although compilation during development is done only with the
g++/gcc GNU C++/C compilers.

1. Extract the package `netmorph-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz`.
   (YYYYMMDD specifies the creation date of the package.)

   A directory netmorph-YYYYMMDD will be created that contains
   the source files of NETMORPH.

2. Run the installation script:
   `./install.sh`

   Successful compilation results in the programs
   `netmorph` and `netmorph2D`.

At this point it is possible to use the netmorph programs to run
simulations of network development. In order to perform evaluation
of simulation results and to produce graphs of a resulting network
and its statistical data, the following additional tools need to
be installed:

`octave` (http://www.octave.org/)
`xfig` (http://www.xfig.org/)
`ImageMagick` (http://www.imagemagick.org/)

These are standard mathematics and graphics packages that are
available through the package managers of all major Linux
distributions.
