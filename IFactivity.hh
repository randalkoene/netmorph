// Classes and definitions for basic IF neural network activity.

// Note: I am declaring this file dependent on the spatial compilation
// for 2D or 3D conditions, i.e. producing separate object files. Although
// this may not seem to be an obvious requirement for IFactivity, it may
// be useful if I decide to add some distance dependent activity effect.
// (And it saves me the trouble of having to define a neuron_base class
// that contains non-spatial parts of the neuron class.)
