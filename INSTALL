Installation Instructions
=========================

NETMORPH depends on the GNU system libraries and is written in standard
C++, although compilation during development is done only with the
g++/gcc GNU C++/C compilers.

1. Extract the package netmorph-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz.
   (YYYYMMDD specifies the creation date of the package.)

   A directory netmorph-YYYYMMDD will be created that contains
   the source files of NETMORPH.

2. Run the installation script:
   ./install.sh

   Successful compilation results in the programs
   netmorph and netmorph2D.

At this point it is possible to use the netmorph programs to run
simulations of network development. In order to perform evaluation
of simulation results and to produce graphs of a resulting network
and its statistical data, the following additional tools need to
be installed:

octave (http://www.octave.org/)
xfig (http://www.xfig.org/)
ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/)

These are standard mathematics and graphics packages that are
available through the package managers of all major Linux
distributions.
